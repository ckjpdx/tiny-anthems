    <meta name="description" content="Personal, whimsical songs for you or a loved one. Tiny Anthems is a way of commissioning an artist (in this case, for now, me) to compose and record an original piece of music about you or a loved one. The idea is that by contributing information that you find most relevant about yourself or another recipient, youâ€™re participating in a kind of dialogue.">

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
