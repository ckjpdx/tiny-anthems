  `What is Tiny Anthems?`,
  `Tiny Anthems is a way of commissioning an artist (in this case, for now, me) to compose and record an original piece of music about you or a loved one. The idea is that by contributing information that you find most relevant about yourself or another recipient, you’re participating in a kind of dialogue. The other part of the dialogue is taken up by the artist, where I create an anthem or kind of theme song about the subject based on the information and intuition. Composed works, whether strictly instrumental or with singing are meant to capture something of the essence of the subject.`,
  `How does this work?`,
  `Using a state-of-the-art questionnaire, those seeking immortality are invited to answer a few simple questions intended to reveal various dimensions of the subject. Based on the information provided to me, I divine an original song about you or your child, parent, spouse, girlfriend, estranged uncle, pet, mailman, parole officer, etc.`,
  `Why are you doing this?`,
  `First it was just boredom and to practice recording/writing, but then it became about making positive, triumphant pieces of art for individuals because I like fun and I think other people like fun.`,
  `How do I get the song?`,
  `Once I complete a work I will notify you that it is ready and you can access and download it from the user page on the website. For those seeking physical copies of their anthem, I’m happy to send a tape, CD, record, braille transcription, performing troubadore or other formats for an appropriate price. `,
  `How much does it cost?`,
  `Tiny Anthems works on a sliding scale. This means that you pay what you feel is commensurate with your income and interest in supporting the arts. No request will be denied due to financial constraints. I suggest that $10-$200 is a reasonable range, given the time involved in the process. The extent of your donation will determine your anthem length and complexity. For example, I will probably not include a marimba solo for a $10.00 donation. Marimba solos are unlocked at $300, probably.`,
  `How long does it take to get my sweet sweet song?`,
  `The length of time to receive a completed masterwork will depend on how many anthems I’m working on, and the complexity/length of the piece. The timeline and order that I work on a piece is loosely determined by an amalgamation of the date the submission was made, the level of the donation, and the nature of the request. If it’s highly touching, or there are external mandates (birthday, holiday, etc) I’ll do my best to comply. I’ll be in touch as the process goes along and try and provide a timeline. If I’m working on a lot of songs, it’ll take longer. If not, sooner. I typically spend probably 15-20 hours working on a piece that adequately extols the virtues of my subjects, so it’s not exactly an overnight process.`,
  `Are you actually writing original pieces for each person?`,
  `Yes. It’s important that the piece not be pre-written or conceived of. I take the questionnaire and overall tone of the person I’m immortalizing through song and write a wholly original piece.`,
  `What will the song sound like?`,
  `There is a huge variety of possibility for the sound. Instrumentation is likely to incorporate acoustic instruments like guitar, cello, drums, banjos, ukuleles and auxiliary percussion, and possibly electric instrumentation including synth, keyboards, electric guitar, organ. Usually the songs tend to be 2-4 minutes in accordance with pop-standards and average listener attention spans, but I'm very open to longer or shorter works. Again, if I feel that the person seems real “country”, you might hear more slide guitar. If they wrote extensively about how much they loved Ireland, I might try and work in some fiddle. Know what I mean? Also, maybe I wouldn’t do any of those things.`,
  `Why don't you get a real job?`,
  `I don’t know, why don’t YOU get a real job?`,
