      <h2>What is This?</h2>
      <p>
        For over 40,000 years, humans have been making music. From flutes made from bones to Mozart's symphonies to that one Kanye album you really like, music has been a consistent part of our lives. In the 21st century, music is more accessible than ever, filling every space in our homes, headphones, and places of commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many forms of music are political, tell love stories, or express anger. Finally, in 2018, after 40,000 years of evolution, the world is ready for a new kind of music: Music written by a weird dude in Portland for strangers celebrating their greatness.
      </p>
      <p>
        One might pay to have a painting done of a loved one or a family dude. One might pay absurd prices to have a marble statue built in their likeness. The goals are the same: to create something that will outlive us, that will celebrate us. So why does music not yet take on this noble pursuit?
      </p>
      <p>
        My quest is to create a somewhat fantastical and ultimately poignant yet comedic piece of music for the people in my community, be that my neighborhood, city, or world. My goal is to make something of value that brings at least a smirk to someone's face and a melody that is unwritten in any other piece of music.
      </p>
      <p>
        All songs are original, all words are original, all humans are original.
      </p>
      <h2>What is this? (Alt)</h2>
      <p>
        In 2012, bored and with some recording gear, I put up a tiny post on Craigslist that said "Be Enshrined in the Glory of Song" offering my very bizarre service to write pieces of music about people based on whatever information they wanted to share. It could be superficial, like a resume, or deeply personal, like a series of dreams. It began as a fun side-quest in my life, but as people responded enthusiastically to some of the songs, I realized that there was something bigger going on. People were super pumped to have weird, over-the-top songs written about how awesome they are by a weird stranger.
      </p>
      <p>
        And thus the website. My goal is to create pieces of music that celebrate people, their weirdness, and ultimately highlight the good in the humanity, and the comedy of life. Through a sort of inquisition, I try and get a sense for the person I'm writing a song about and let creative agency do the rest. Some songs end up being long and detailed stories about people. Some end of taking weird tangents into topics that are completely irrelevant, but ultimately, my goal is to make music for people that doesn't exist elsewhere. Everything is original, sometimes it's just me, and sometimes I get friends involved.
