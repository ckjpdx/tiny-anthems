Curl into a furry donut. Find something else more interesting meow all night yet cough yet howl uncontrollably for no reason or demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it yet lick the other cats. Scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food roll over and sun my belly. Stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock for pushes butt to face for stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust and dead stare with ears cocked toilet paper attack claws fluff everywhere meow miao french ciao litterbox.
