      <p>Below are a few examples of actual Tiny Anthems composed for people who submitted a request for a song.</p>
      <iframe title="Portland Monthly" width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameBorder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/532413651&color=%23a85476&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>
      <p className="sample-description">This song was requested by Portland Monthly Magazine to accompany a written and online piece about Tiny Anthems for publication in their Feb 2019 issue. They gave me artistic liberty, so I composed a song about how dreadful and terrible life was before the magazine went into publication, and how much more glorious life subsequently became following the magazine’s debut.</p>
      <iframe title="song" width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameBorder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/532418829&color=%23a85476&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>
      <p className="sample-description">This song was composed for someone’s wife as a Christmas gift. Sharing her affinity for swimming and some other details, I conceived of a song in the form of a podcast about how her supernaturally good swimming skills got her tangled up with local law enforcement. It is presently being pressed to vinyl.</p>
      <iframe title="song" width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameBorder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/532415085&color=%23a85476&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>
      <p className="sample-description">This short song was written for a young person with an affinity for stones, metaphysics, and the natural world. The song is dynamic, changing, and driving to mirror her responses to my questions.</p>
      <iframe title="song" width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameBorder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/507958182&color=%23a85476&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>
      <p className="sample-description">This song was written entirely based on a polygraph test that the subject sent to me. I composed an instrumental work based on the graph of her heart rate and pulse. The song is presently being used as a foundation for a dance performance in Budapest, Hungary.</p>
      <iframe title="song" width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameBorder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/507952284&color=%23a85476&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>
      <p className="sample-description">Harvey’s song request came from a family member of his. They told me about his passion for environmental rights and justice, and I penned a song wherein Harvey is a sort of larger-than-life hero.</p>
      <iframe title="song" width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameBorder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/507946152&color=%23a85476&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>
      <p className="sample-description">Jennifer was one of my first anthems and saw my notecard stuck to a bulletin board in North East  Portland. She spoke of her enthusiasm for Photography and her meager cooking skills and I composed this Anthem to memorialize her exceptional skills behind the camera, if not in the kitchen.</p>
