        This song was composed for someone’s wife as a Christmas gift. Sharing her affinity for swimming and some other details, I conceived of a song in the form of a podcast about how her supernaturally good swimming skills got her tangled up with local law enforcement. It is presently being pressed to vinyl.

        Harvey’s song request came from a family member of his. They told me about his passion for environmental rights and justice, and I penned a song wherein Harvey is a sort of larger-than-life hero.

        This song was requested by Portland Monthly Magazine to accompany a written and online piece about Tiny Anthems for publication in their Feb 2019 issue. They gave me artistic liberty, so I composed a song about how dreadful and terrible life was before the magazine went into publication, and how much more glorious life subsequently became following the magazine’s debut.
