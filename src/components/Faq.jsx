      <h2>
        How does this work?
      </h2>
      <p>
        You provide whatever info you think is relevant and I make a weird song about you or your child, parent, spouse, girlfriend, estranged uncle, pet, mailman, parole officer, etc. Based on what information I received, I compose an original song about the subject.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why are you doing this?
      </h2>
      <p>
        First it was just boredom and to practice recording/writing, but then it became about making positive, triumphant pieces of art for individuals because I like fun and I think other people like fun.
      </p>
      <h2>
        How do I get the song?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I will email you when your song is complete, which can be downloaded from the "REC." button (user area) on this site. Tapes and CD's available upon request for an additional fee.
      </p>
      <h2>
        How much does it cost?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I ask for a $10 dollar minimum, which is still insanely modest given that I tend to spend absurd amounts of time planning the song, recording the song, re-recording the song, starting over because the first song kind of sucked, talking to my therapist about why I’m doing this, struggling with my identity, and then finally sitting down to finish the song and send it out.
      </p>
      <h2>
        How long does it take to get my sweet sweet song?
      </h2>
      <p>
        1-4 weeks. I ain’t some prince, I have a regular job, so I put on my superhero mask after work. After you let me know you want a song (via the questionnaire or otherwise) I’ll contact you and try and give you an approximate timeline. If I’m working on a lot of songs, it’ll take longer. If not, sooner. I typically spend probably 15-20 hours working on a piece that adequately extols the virtues of my subjects, so it’s not exactly an overnight process.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Are you actually writing original pieces for each person?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Yes. It’s important that the piece not be pre-written or conceived of. I take the questionnaire and overall tone of the person I’m immortalizing through song and write a wholly original piece.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What will the song sound like?
      </h2>
      <p>
        There is a huge variety of possibility for the sound. Instrumentation is likely to incorporate acoustic instruments like guitar, cello, drums, banjos, ukuleles and auxiliary percussion, and possibly electric instrumentation including synth, keyboards, electric guitar, organ. Usually the songs tend to be 2-4 minutes in accordance with pop-standards and average listener attention spans, but I'm very open to longer or shorter works. Again, if I feel that the person seems real “country”, you could expect more slide guitar. If they seemed really bummed out, minor chords and sad sounds would be the main event.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why don't you get a real job?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I don’t know, why don’t YOU get a real job?
      </p>
